**ðŸ’¡ NeuroBench-LS **, a unified benchmark framework designed to evaluate and enhance the generalizability of foundation models across the human lifespan using brain MRI. *** 

## ðŸ“‹ Our Dataset

We provide a comprehensive MRI dataset on [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/) spanning the full human lifespanâ€”from fetus and infant to elderly adults. The collection includes over **22,000** high-quality **T1-weighted** and **T2-weighted** structural brain MRI scans.

- **Publicly released subcortical segmentation** are available via the official [Dataverse link](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/B5OU7H).
- **Private or restricted datasets** can be accessed upon request. Please contact the corresponding principal investigator (PI) for access approval.

For more details on data usage, structure, and benchmarks, please refer to the full documentation in this repository.

    If you are using Python, this means providing a `requirements.txt` file (if using `pip` and `virtualenv`), providing `environment.yml` file (if using anaconda), or a `setup.py` if your code is a library. 

It is good practice to provide a section in your README.md that explains how to install these dependencies. Assume minimal background knowledge and be clear and comprehensive - if users cannot set up your dependencies they are likely to give up on the rest of your code as well. 

If you wish to provide whole reproducible environments, you might want to consider using Docker and upload a Docker image of your environment into Dockerhub. 

#### 2. Installation

We procide`requirements.txt`in each bench. All model under PyTorch-GPU.

#### 3. Evaluation code

We provide eval.py for each bench.
